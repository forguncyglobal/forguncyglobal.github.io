# Forguncy Documentation

Welcome to the Forguncy Documentation.

Forguncy is a software package for developing and deploying a web application that is data-driven and context-sensitive. It can perform various client-side and server-side actions. You can debug, test, and tweak your web application every step of the way, as required in any software development proces. It is also highly extensible.

It consists of the following two software:  
**Builder** is a development environment where you will design, build, debug and test your web application. Click **[here](overview/about-forguncy-builder/)** to know more.

**Server** is a server component that serves (hosts) the web applications you create. Once your web application is developed using the Builder, it must be hosted on a server. Click **[here](overview/about-forguncy-server/)** to know more.
