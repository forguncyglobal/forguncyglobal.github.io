Forguncy offers a variety of quick styles to make your listview look great.

You can also customize the style if you want something other than the default list view style.

## Quick style

Select the list view, and click **Styles** in the **Design** ribbon tab. A list of styles will appear in a dropdown. Select any style to apply to the list view.

List view styles are categorized by color intensity into three categories: **Light**, **Medium**, and **Dark**. These are very similar to Excel table styles. 

Each style uses the theme's color scheme, so changing the theme also changes the default style.

## Creating a new List view style
If you want a different look than the default styles, you can create custom styles.

- After selecting the list view, go to the **Design** ribbon tab, and select **Style**.
- Click **New List View Style...** to open the **List View Style Settings** dialog.
- Give a name to your style.
- Set styles for respective elements in the listview. <br/> Select any element from **List view Elements** and do the required settings in **Element Formatting**.
- You can preview the set effect on the right side of the screen- **Preview** area.
- Click the **OK** button to save your custom style. 
- Custom list view style will appear under **User Setting**. 

You can import custom styles into the current project.

Note- <br/> If the current project has a custom style with the same name then you can not import your new custom style. <br/> Also, default styles are not imported even if the default styles in the importing project have been modified.

## Working with List view styles

Right-click on the list-view and select the required option from the context menu. You can perform operations like **Edit**, **Remove**, **Duplicate**, **Set as Default**, and **Find References..** on the custom list view. For built-in list view styles, the operations are same except **Remove**. 

Note- Built-in list view styles cannot be deleted.

You can make changes or delete custom list view by right-clicking and selecting right option from the context menu. 
Both built-in list view styles and custom list view styles are editable. You can set styles for list view elements in the List View Styles dialog by right-clicking the desired list view style and selecting **Edit...** from the context menu.

You can duplicate both built-in list view styles and custom list view styles. Duplicated list view styles can be edited. After saving, the cloned list view style will appear in the Custom Styles area. Right-click the target list view style and select **Duplicate** from the context menu to open the **List View Style Settings** dialog.

Rest option is available only for built-in list view styles. Right-click the target list view style and select **Reset** from the context menu. 

Both built-in list view styles and custom styles can be set as default styles. If you set a listview style as the default style, all listviews you create in the current Forguncy project will have that style. Right-click the desired list view style and select **Set as Default** from the context menu.

Use this function to find all listviews with this style applied. Right-click the desired list view style and select **Find References** from the context menu. Search results are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

You can clear any listview styles you have applied. If you clear the style, the list view will be in a no style applied state. 

After selecting the target list view, go to the **Design** ribbon tab and select **Clear**.
