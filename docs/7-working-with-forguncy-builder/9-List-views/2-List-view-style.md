Forguncy offers a variety of quick styles to make your listview look great.

You can also customize the style if you want something other than the default list view style.

## Quick style

Select the list view, and click **Styles** in the **Design** ribbon tab. A list of styles will appear in a dropdown. Select any style to apply to the list view.

List view styles are categorized by color intensity into three categories: **Light**, **Medium**, and **Dark**. These are very similar to Excel table styles. 

Each style uses the theme's color scheme, so changing the theme also changes the default style.

If you want a different look than the default styles, you can create custom styles.

You can import custom styles into the current project.

Note- <br/> If the current project has a custom style with the same name then you can not import your new custom style. <br/> Also, default styles are not imported even if the default styles in the importing project have been modified.
