Forguncy's report function is realized by outputting the page to a PDF file or an Excel file. However, since a page is originally an object to be displayed on a web browser, simply outputting the page content to a PDF file or Excel file will not make the content suitable for printing. Therefore, by adding the settings required for the report to the page, it supports many form formats that are generally required.
