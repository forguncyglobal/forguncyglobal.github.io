Use the [Subscribe]() command to set the function to automatically send notification emails when data is updated. 

Since the e-mail is sent to the e-mail address of the registered user account, it is necessary to use a user account to use this function.

- After configuring mail server settings, add **Subscribe** command to a button.

- Set up subscription details. 

The user of the application can select and set whether or not to receive the created email notification function for each user account. Make the selected cell a login user type by referring to Creating a login user so that you can use the user authentication mechanismã€€ . If you are not logged in and try to execute the [Register for email notification] command, you will automatically be redirected to the login screen and prompted to log in.

Debug to check the operation.
- Log in as "Administrator" and execute the "E-mail notification registration" command set in step 2
- Select Notify me on all changes and click OK.
- An e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address set in "Administrator" indicating that the notification settings have been completed.
- Edit the table in your application using the Update Table Data command.
- Confirm that the notification e-mail has been sent to the e-mail address set for "Administrator".
