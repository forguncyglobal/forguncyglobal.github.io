Formulas can be set in cells and in list view template rows just like in Excel.

Formulas can be typed directly into the cell or set as the cell's default value, depending on the cell type. The following cell types are supported when setting as the default value for a cell

- Text box
- Multiline text box
- Checkbox group
- Radio group
- Combo box
- Numerical value
- Date
- Times of Day
- User selection combo box

You can also type directly into the cell by entering the formula followed by "=". Let's take an example of adding two values.
