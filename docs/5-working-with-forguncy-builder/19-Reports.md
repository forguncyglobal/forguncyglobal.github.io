Forguncy has a function to export page objects to PDF or Excel for display on a web browser. You can use this function to export forms such as quotations, sales slips, etc. However, the main purpose of the page object is to display it on a web browser and hence there is a limitation for form output. By using report objects, it is possible to overcome this challenge. Report objects support more detailed form layouts.
