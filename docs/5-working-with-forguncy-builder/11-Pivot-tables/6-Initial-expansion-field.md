Pivot tables expand all fields by default. When everything is expanded, visibility may not be good in case of many rows and columns. It is possible to set the initial expansion field.

Note: During runtime, the user can expand and collapse any field by clicking the **+** or **-** icon.
{:.note}

- Select a pivot table and open **Pivot Table Settings** available on the the right pane.
- Go to **Other** tab in the **Pivot Table Settings** dialog for the settings.

Row and column headers can each have an initial expansion field. The method of setting the initial expansion field is the same for both row headers and column headers. The options that can be set are:

- Expand all fields (all fields will be expanded)
- Do not expand (all fields will be collapsed)
- All fields except the last field in a row or column
