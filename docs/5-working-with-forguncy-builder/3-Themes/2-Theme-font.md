Fonts are another important element of a theme. You can change the theme's font after selecting a theme.

- Go to **Design** ribbon tab.
- Click **Fonts** dropdown.
- Select the font you want to set from the font list to apply.



If you change the font, all elements that have the theme's font applied will update to the new font.

The theme font is applied to all elements as the default font when creating a page.

By changing the theme font to the target font, you can change the font of the entire page at once.
