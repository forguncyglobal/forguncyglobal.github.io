The web pages that are compatible with mobile devices are termed as Mobile pages in Forguncy builder.  

You can design mobile versions of normal pages i.e. the normal page is displayed when the page is accessed from a computer, and when the page is accessed from a mobile device, the specified mobile page is automatically displayed.

Note: On mobile devices, you can delete list view data, but you cannot edit or add items to it.
