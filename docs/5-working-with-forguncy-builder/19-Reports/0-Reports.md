The **Report** feature of **Forguncy** offers a reporting solution to design, customize, publish, and view reports in web applications. 

The report is a statistical analysis tool that can be used to achieve different reports such as weekly sales reports, monthly financial reports, and statistical analysis of the entyerprise data. It allows detailed data display and analysis.

With the **Report** feature, developers can easily build various reports and end users can view these reports directly in the browser, and can also export them as PDF files with one click (which is convenient for printing and filing).

Some of the most commonly used report types built using the Forguncy **Report** feature are:

- Excel forms (financial statements, accounting statements, statistical statements)
- Word document class (quality inspection report, test result report, irregular table)
- Dashboard management Kanban (big screen cockpit)
- Group report, column report, tree structure multi-layer statistical report
- All kinds of printing documents and reports

<!-- Forguncy has a function to export page objects to PDF or Excel for display on a web browser. You can use this function to export forms such as quotations, sales slips, etc. However, the main purpose of the page object is to display it on a web browser and hence there is a limitation for form output. By using report objects, it is possible to overcome this challenge. Report objects support more detailed form layouts. -->
