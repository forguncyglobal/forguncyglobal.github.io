- To set the Excel Page settings, use **Print Setup** dialog of **Print layout** tab.
- When you run the **Export Page to Excel** command on a master page, only the child pages displayed in the placeholder are exported to the Excel file.
- If a page other than *Current page* is selected in **Page**, the following pages will not be exported correctly. <br/> Such  page can be displayed correctly in a web browser and then can be exported to obtain correct results-

    - If you have set the cell value in pageload command and you export without actually loading the page on the web browser, the pageload command will not be executed.
    - If you have a cell reference such as "=A1" in the query that extracts the data to be displayed on the page. The value of a cell that references such a cell is determined only after it is displayed on the web browser. As a result, you will not get correct query results.
- The output result of the export differs depending on the cell type.
