Fonts are one of the elements that make up a theme. After selecting a theme, you can change the theme's font.

Click [Design] ribbon tab - [Font], select the font you want to set from the font list, and apply it.

If you change the font, all elements that have the theme's font applied will update to the new font.

The theme font is applied to all elements as the default font when creating a page.

By changing the theme font to the target font, you can change the font of the entire page at once.
