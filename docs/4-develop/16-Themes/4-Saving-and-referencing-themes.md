If you have customized the default theme, you can save it as a Forguncy theme file. You can apply a customized theme by importing that file in another project.

## Save theme
After customizing the theme color scheme, theme fonts, and theme images, from the Design ribbon tab, click the icon and select Save Current Theme. Then enter a name for the file to save and click the Save button.
Themes are saved as files with the extension "FGCTHEME".

## Theme reference
If you have a saved Forguncy theme file, you can apply the theme to the current project by loading that file.

Click [Browse Themes...], select the target Forgunncy theme file, and click the [Open] button.
