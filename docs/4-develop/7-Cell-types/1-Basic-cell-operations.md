Format and Description of the numbers are shown below.
#### Table: Description of the number format

|Format|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**General**|The default numeric format applied to Forguncy when typing numbers. In most cases, numbers formatted as General are displayed as they are typed. However, if the cell is not wide enough to display the entire number, the regular format rounds off the number with a decimal point. The regular number format also uses scientific count (exponential) notation for larger numbers (12 digits or more).|
|**Numeric value**|Used for a general representation of numbers. You can specify the number of decimal places to use, whether to use the thousands separator, and how to display negative numbers.|
|**Currency**|Used for general currency values and displays a default currency symbol with numbers. You can specify the number of decimal places to use, whether to use the thousands separator, and how to display negative numbers.|
|**Accounting**|Also used for currency values, but it aligns the currency symbol and the decimal point of the number in a column.|
|**Date**|Displays the date and time sequence number as a date value based on the type and locale (country/region) that you specify. Date formats that begin with an asterisk (*) are affected by changes in the regional date and time settings that you specify in control panel. Formats without an asterisk are not affected by the control panel settings.|
|**Time**|Displays the date and time sequence number as a time value based on the type and locale (country/region) that you specify the format. Time that begins with an asterisk (*) is affected by changes in the regional date and time settings that you specify in control panel. formats without an asterisk are not affected by the control panel settings.|
|**Percentage**|Multiplies the cell value by 100 and displays the result with the percent sign (%). You can specify the number of decimal places to use.|
|**Fraction**|Displays numbers as fractions based on the type of score you specify.|
|**Scientific**|Displays numbers in exponential notation, replacing some of them with E+n, where E (for exponent) refers to multiplying the preceding number by the nth power of 10. For example, the Scientific Count format for 2 decimal places displays 12345678901 as 1.23E+10, which is a 10-step power of 1.23 multiplied by 10. You can specify the number of decimal places to use.|
|**Text**|Treats the contents of a cell as text and displays the contents accurately as you type, even if you type a number.|
|**Special**|Displays numbers as postal codes, Indian lowercase numbers, or chinese uppercase numbers.|
|**Custom**|Enables you to modify a copy of an existing numeric format code. Use this format to create a custom number format that you add to the list of number format codes.|
