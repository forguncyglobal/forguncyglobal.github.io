## Activate
The **Forguncy Server** is a premium product that needs to be purchased at https://buy.forguncy.net/ or by contacting [support@forguncy.net](mailto:support@forguncy.net). On successful purchase, you will be given a license key that needs to be installed and activated on the Forguncy Server Manger.


### Online Activation
If the server you're installing the Forguncy Server is on the working internet, the activation of the Forguncy Server happens automatically.
