## Feature Highlights
Following are some of the key features of Forguncy Builder.

### Pages &amp; Master Pages
Pages are the visual interface of your web application with which the user of your web application interacts.
-  Forguncy provides over ten built-in pages commonly required in a web application, such as pages for sign-in, password reset, under construction, and 401 (also known as page-not-found page). The built-in pages are fully customizable.
- The same set of built-in pages is also provided in mobile-friendly sizes.
- You can create master pages that the regular pages can be associated with. The master pages allow for efficient web application development and help maintain a consistent look and feel of your web application.

### Cell Types
While working in the Builder, the page area is provided to you in sections of cells with columns and rows, just as in Microsoft Excel documents. 

You can interact with each cell as an object having a unique cell reference address. You can merge multiple cells into one cell to create a larger area. You can place text in a cell and can change its font, background color, and even set borders.

Any cell's default type is General type, but you can extend its capabilities by applying different cell types. Forguncy provides over a couple of dozens of cell types out of the box, and some of the most common cell types are Text, Button, Checkbox, Radio Group, Hyperlink, Dropdown List, Number, Date, Image, Menu, Tree, and Barcode to name just a few. You can download and install many plugins to add many more cell types, such as Carousel, Tabs, and Gantt.

### Number Formats
Number formats define how the underlying cell value is represented, whether the value is a number, date, time, text, percentage, scientific, currency, or accounting. If you're familiar with this from Microsoft Excel, you're at home.

### Formulas
The Forguncy supports over 300 formulas that are found in Microsoft Excel.

### Conditional Formatting
Cells can have automatic formattings applied to cells based on their values. Just as in Microsoft Excel, rules also support formulas.

### Named Cell Reference
Cell references can be assigned names, which helps make your formulas more readable and understandable.

### Data Validation
You can use data validation to restrict the type of value that users enter into a cell.

### Debug &amp; Run
Forguncy Builder allows you to build and run your web application on your desktop (the development environment) on the choice of browsers. It helps in incremental development.

When using objects such as a table, listview, objects, and cell references across many pages, master pages, and reports, it becomes impossible to keep track of where they are being used. Forguncy Builder allows you to check where a particular object or cell reference is referenced.

### Themes
Themes allow you to give a consistent look to your web application and make it easy to change the look and feel of your application quickly.
