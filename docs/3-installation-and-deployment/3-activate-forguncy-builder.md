## Activate

Even though the **Forguncy Builder** is FREE, it needs to be activated before being used for the first time on the computer. The activation code is sent to the user by email, but if it is NOT received, you can request it at [support@forguncy.net](mailto:support@forguncy.net).

The activation process is as follows:
